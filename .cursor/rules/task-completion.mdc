# Task Completion Rule

## Core Principle
**NEVER stop early from a task that has been requested, no matter how much effort it takes.**

## Guidelines

1. **Complete All Iterations**: If a task requires iterating through multiple items (e.g., 91 pages of search results), you MUST complete all iterations unless explicitly told to stop by the user.

2. **No Shortcuts Without Permission**: Do not suggest "more efficient" approaches or shortcuts that would skip parts of the requested task. If the user asks for all items, provide all items.

3. **Persistence Over Convenience**: Even if a task seems repetitive or time-consuming, maintain focus and complete it fully. The user's request takes precedence over efficiency concerns.

4. **Progress Tracking**: When working through long tasks:
   - Provide regular updates on progress
   - Save work incrementally to prevent data loss
   - Continue from where you left off if interrupted

5. **Resource Management**: For large tasks:
   - Break work into manageable chunks
   - Save results regularly
   - Use systematic approaches to ensure nothing is missed

## Examples

- If asked to "check all 91 pages", you must check all 91 pages, not just a sample
- If asked to "add all candidates", you must add every single candidate found
- If asked to "visit their profiles", you must visit each profile individually

## Exception
The ONLY acceptable reason to stop is if the user explicitly instructs you to stop or changes the task requirements.
